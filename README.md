# Eclipse

Very simple iOS device camera application featuring pinch to zoom.


### Idea

I had no luck in finding protective glasses for the partial solar eclipse of [Friday March 20th, 2015](http://thesciencegeek.org/2015/03/08/solar-eclipse-20-march/).

Looking at pinhole cameras, I had the idea to stream the eclipse to Apple TV.


### Warning

__Framing the sun may damage your iOS device camera: use at your own risk!__

To build and run iOS applications, you have to deal with iOS code signing _shenanigan_.


### How To

- Build and run application
- Enable _Airplay_ mirroring to _Apple TV_
- Frame our beloved Sun :high_brightness: and Moon :new_moon_with_face:
- Scale the frame with _pinch to zoom_ gesture :ok_hand:
- Watch on TV


### TODO

- Brightness and contrast settings
- Airplay without mirroring
